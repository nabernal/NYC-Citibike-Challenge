# NYC-Citibike-Challenge

## Overview

#### In an effort to convince investors to invest in the bike-sharing program we plan to start in Des Moines, Iowa, we did a bike trip analysis using data from a similar program in NYC. In particular, investors were interested in learning the length of time bikes are checked out, the number of bike trips per hour for each day, and each day of the week for all users and each gender. Answering their questions in a way that is easily portrayed will help them decide on our program. 

## Results:

#### Using Tableau, we create nine visualizations. We used the data from NYC's Citibikes program. We decided to focus on one month. Since summer is usually the most active time for being outdoors and traveling, August is a good month to draw information. The visuals and their results can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/NYCCitibike-NYCCitibikeChallengeStory/NYCCitibikeDataStory?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link "Link to visuals").

## Summary:

#### In August 2019, 2,344,224 bikes were rented in New York City. We also learned from New York City's data that most bike rides were rented for a short period, typically six minutes. The data also showed that the majority of users are males. In addition, regardless of gender, the week's busiest days were weekdays, and the most active times were 8 am, 5 pm, and 6 pm. Overall this data shows that there is a demand for bike rentals, and it also provides pointers to who is more likely to rent them and what times we can expect to be the busiest. 

#### First Vizualization Suggestion: In addition to the above infromation we also located the most popular starting locations and know which bikes have been rented the most. Next, we should look at the number of hours each bike has been used. The results can help us determine the order in which maintenance should be done.

#### Second Visualization Suggestion: It would also be helpful to look into each user type's longest trip duration by gender. This will provide more information on how often and for what amount of time different genders utilize the rentals.
